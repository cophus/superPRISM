# superPRISM
### An even faster algorithm for STEM image simulation


This set of scripts is an implementation of our new "partitioned PRISM" algorithm, 
designed by Philipp Pelz and Colin Ophus. Currently uses atomic potential parameterization
from "Advanced Computing in Electron Microscopy, 3rd Edition," by E Kirkland. Atomic 
potentials are computed using the 3D lookup table method from Luis Rangel DaCosta and 
Colin Ophus. Includes a multislice implementation for comparison.
